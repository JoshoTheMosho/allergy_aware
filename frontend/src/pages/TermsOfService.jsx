        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: November 26, 2024</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to AllerGenie. By accessing or using our services, you agree to be
            bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). Please read them carefully.
        </p>

        <h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
            Users are fully responsible for the accuracy of the information they
            provide, including restaurant details, dish ingredients, and allergen
            information. Users must ensure that all information is correct and
            up-to-date.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account
            credentials. The restaurant should use one account and not share it with
            individuals outside of the organization.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
        <p>
            Users agree not to misuse the app, attempt unauthorized access, or violate
            any intellectual property rights associated with AllerGenie. Prohibited
            actions include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Distributing malware or harmful code</li>
            <li>Attempting to access other users' data without authorization</li>
            <li>Engaging in activities that disrupt or impair the app's functionality</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
            All content provided by AllerGenie, excluding user-generated content, is
            the property of AllerGenie and is protected by intellectual property laws.
            Users retain ownership of the content they submit but grant AllerGenie a
            non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use it for the purpose of providing
            and improving the services.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Termination</h2>
        <p>
            AllerGenie reserves the right to terminate or suspend access to the
            service at any time, with or without notice, for conduct that AllerGenie
            believes violates these Terms or is harmful to other users or the service.
            In most cases, we will provide a notice period before termination unless
            the violation is severe.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Early Development and "As Is" Basis:</strong> AllerGenie is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. The app is in early development and may have bugs, errors, or inaccuracies with information that is uploaded, saved, edited, stored, and searched for. We make no warranties, expressed or implied, regarding the app's performance or reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>No Liability for User-Provided Information:</strong> AllerGenie is not liable for any inaccuracies or errors in the information provided or entered by users. Users are solely responsible for the information they input into the app.

            <strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> In no event shall AllerGenie be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with the use or inability to use the app, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Allergic Reactions and Health Issues:</strong> AllerGenie is not liable in cases where inaccurate information provided or entered by the user is used as fact in situations resulting in allergic reactions or other health issues. Users should not rely solely on the app for critical health-related decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users acknowledge that AllerGenie is developed by students and may contain bugs or errors. While we strive to address issues promptly upon becoming aware of them, we cannot guarantee the app's performance or accuracy.

        </p>

        <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            AllerGenie may use third-party services such as Supabase, Google Vision
            API, Railway, and AWS Lambda to provide the service. Use of these services
            is subject to their respective terms and policies.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>
            If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms, please contact us
            at [TBD].

        <h2>11. Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and AllerGenie
            regarding the use of the app and supersede any prior agreements.
        </p>

        <h2>12. User-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>
            Users can submit allergen, ingredient, and dish information that only they
            can access. AllerGenie does not claim ownership of user-generated content
            but may use aggregated data to improve the service. We respect the
            confidentiality of proprietary recipes and will not disclose specific dish
            details.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
            Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be resolved
            in accordance with the laws of Canada. Users agree to submit to the
            jurisdiction of Canadian courts for the resolution of any disputes.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Age Restrictions</h2>
        <p>
            There is no minimum age requirement for users. However, the app is
            intended for use by restaurant staff. Users are not required to confirm
            they are of legal working age in their country.
